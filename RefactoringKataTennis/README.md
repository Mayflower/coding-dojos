# This are the sources from our Refactoring Coding Dojo at Mayflower GmbH on 08. Oct. 2013

## What have we done?
We used the Tennis Game kata to train our refactoring skills.
This kata is based on Emily Baches Tennis Kata (https://github.com/emilybache/Tennis-Refactoring-Kata/tree/master/javascript).
I have added the Jasmine-Tests.

We used TDD and Pair Programming.

## We used this tools
* PHPStorm & jsTestDriver-Plugin
* Jasmine & Jasmine adapter (which is also in this repo)

## How to use it?
There are three variants of the kata, named Tennis1, Tennis2 and Tennis3. For details about the kata see the file Tennis.txt.
I also added a file with the hyperlink for plato, a JavaScript source code visualization, static analysis, and complexity analysis tool.
Last but not least I added a list of common Code Smells in CodeSmells.txt

Have fun doing this kata!
